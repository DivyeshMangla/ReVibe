## Expected JWT Payload

When user logs in, JWT should contain:
```json
{
  "email": "john.doe@company.com",
  "sub": "user-id-uuid",
  "role": "EMPLOYEE",
  "employeeId": "employee-id-uuid"
}
```

This allows backend to:
- Identify the user
- Check their role
- Link to their employee record
- Filter data based on permissions

---

## Next Steps

1. Update frontend to store role in auth state
2. Create role-based route protection
3. Update forms to auto-fill current user for employees
4. Filter data by role (e.g., supervisor sees only their team)
5. Hide/show UI elements based on role
6. Test all workflows with different roles
